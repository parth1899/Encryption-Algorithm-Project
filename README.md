# Encryption-Project

This is a simple example of cipher algorithm which uses **Binary Tree** for second level encryption.

Cryptography is modifying your data in such a way that only you and the receiver know the real data while any other intermediate person (hacker, request, etc) cannot interpret the meaning of modified data. Cryptography mainly include two steps ENCRYPTION and DECRYPTION.

In our code we are using two level Encryption. First level encryption uses substitution and second level encryption uses Tree Traversal.
